Russian/cyrillic support;
	Re-optimize
	Research high-numerics (6 and up)
	Test '-' patterns for TEX hacks

PHPUnit testsuite

Implement left/right hyphen-min:
	i.e. (2,3) means atleast 2 chars on left and 3 chars on right
		So do no try anything less than (2 + 3) in length, test scoring from [1+2] upto [0-3]?
	Put them in a central file somewhere?
Internal run-time cache per run (~20% performance improvement).
Internal run-time cache per language (contains entire word and numbers).
Internal caches with/without scoring?
Change the caches to use a single load/save point instead of on get/set
Errors on file-not-found or otherwise in strategies. When to quit?
Pre-split pre-hyphenated text?

Cache levels
	Numbers (allows changing treshold)
	Split (allows multiple hyphenation methods)
	Hyphenated (probably most common case) *
Locality
	Static (shared for language over all calls) *
	Dynamic (only for current call)
